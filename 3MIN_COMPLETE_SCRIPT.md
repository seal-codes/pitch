# seal.codes - 3-Minute Complete Script
## Hackathon Pitch Presentation (Short Version)

---

### Slide 1: Title - seal.codes

At the heart of every human interaction lies trust. Today I'll show you how we're bringing that trust back to our digital world with seal.codes.

---

### Slide 2: Foundation of Trust

For millennia, humans used visible seals to prove authenticity - royal seals pressed into wax that instantly communicated who stood behind a document. But in our digital world, that foundation of trust is crumbling.

---

### Slide 3: Digital Chaos

We're constantly forced to ask: Is this real? Is this authentic? Who is truly behind this? Meet Sarah, whose art gets stolen daily. Meet Alex, forced to gamble on whether sellers are legitimate or scams.

---

### Slide 4: Creator's Dilemma - Sarah's Story

This is Sarah, a creator whose art gets stolen daily with no way to prove ownership. When her work is taken and her ownership erased, she loses credit, income, and trust with her audience.

---

### Slide 5: Buyer's Gamble - Alex's Story

This is Alex, forced to gamble when buying online - unsure if sellers are legitimate or scams. The anonymity that should protect privacy instead breeds mistrust.

---

### Slide 6: Meet seal.codes

seal.codes brings digital seals that are infinitely more powerful than wax. They contain encrypted document and identity data, automatically break if tampered with, and are impossible to forge. Simple elegance meets modern cryptography.

---

### Slide 7: How It Works

In contrast to complex solutions like PKI that require technical expertise, here's how simple seal.codes is: Upload your document, login with a social account you already have, get your digital seal. No private keys, no certificates, no complexity.

---

### Slide 8: Sarah's Success

Now Sarah can proudly declare "This is mine" with verifiable proof embedded directly in her work. She's restoring trust in her creative interactions.

---

### Slide 9: Alex's Confidence

Alex can now trust his trading partners through verified social identities - which are often better protected than physical ID cards with their two-factor authentication and digital history. The seal acts as his digital handshake.

---

### Slide 10: Innovation Showcase
