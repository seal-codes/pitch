With a seal.codes verified image, Alex can now be absolutely sure that his trading partner owns the identity behind the seal. Yes, it's "only" a social identity - but here's what's remarkable: some social identities are actually better protected than physical identity documents. Think about it - your Google account has two-factor authentication, recovery processes, and years of digital history. Your GitHub profile shows your actual work and reputation. These social identities often have stronger verification and protection mechanisms than a simple ID card that can be faked.

The seal acts as Alex's digital handshake, connecting him directly to a verified social identity. It removes the doubt, prevents the fraud, and allows a trusted transaction to take place - backed by the robust security of established social platforms.
