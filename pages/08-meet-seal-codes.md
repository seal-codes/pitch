seal.codes was created to solve this. We believe the solution isn't to build more complex systems, but to return to the simple clarity of a visible mark of trust. 

But here's what makes our digital seals revolutionary: Unlike a wax seal that just shows "this was sealed," our digital seals are infinitely more powerful. They contain all the information about the document AND the creator's identity encrypted within the seal itself. And here's the brilliant part - if anyone tries to tamper with the document, the seal breaks automatically. It's like having a wax seal that not only shows authenticity but also self-destructs if someone tries to forge it.

We're bringing the simple, elegant concept of the seal to the digital age - but supercharged with modern cryptographic technology.
