# seal.codes - 3-Minute Hackathon Script
## Condensed Version for Video Submission

---

### Opening Hook (20 seconds)
At the heart of every human interaction lies trust. For millennia, we used visible seals to prove authenticity - royal seals pressed into wax that instantly communicated who stood behind a document. But in our digital world, that foundation of trust is crumbling.

### The Problem (30 seconds)
Meet Sarah, a creator whose art gets stolen daily with no way to prove ownership. Meet Alex, a buyer forced to gamble on whether sellers are legitimate or scams. We're constantly asking: Is this real? Is this authentic? Who is truly behind this?

### Failed Solutions (20 seconds)
Brilliant minds tried to solve this with complex cryptographic solutions like PGP and PKI. But these tools have a fatal flaw - they were built by experts, for experts, requiring technical knowledge that puts them out of reach for almost everyone.

### Our Solution (40 seconds)
seal.codes brings the simple elegance of seals to the digital age - but infinitely more powerful. Unlike wax seals that just show "this was sealed," our digital seals contain all document and identity information encrypted within, and automatically break if tampered with.

Here's how simple it is: Upload your document, login with a social account you already have, get your digital seal. No private keys, no certificates, no complexity. The seal embeds as a QR code that anyone can verify instantly.

### The Impact (30 seconds)
Now Sarah can proudly declare "This is mine" with verifiable proof. Alex can trust his trading partners through verified social identities - which are often better protected than physical ID cards with their two-factor authentication and digital history.

### Innovation & Vision (20 seconds)
Built with 88% AI assistance, this isn't another app clone - we solved a fundamental internet problem. Our vision: empowering every user to leverage their existing social identities to prove ownership and authenticity.
