# LLM Image Generation Prompts for seal.codes Pitch Deck

## Missing Images to Generate

### 1. Complex Cryptographic Network (Slide 7 - Expert's Curse)
**Filename**: `cryptographic-complexity.png`
**Prompt**: 
```
Abstract visualization of complex cryptographic network with PKI certificates, keys, and technical diagrams, dark tech aesthetic, overwhelming complexity. Show interconnected nodes with certificate chains, private keys floating around, complex mathematical formulas, technical documentation scattered, all in a dark blue/black color scheme. The image should convey technical overwhelm and complexity that intimidates regular users. Style: modern tech illustration, slightly chaotic arrangement to show complexity.
```

### 2. Seal Transformation Concept (Slide 8 - Digital Seals Solution)
**Filename**: `seal-transformation.png`
**Prompt**: 
```
Elegant transformation from ancient wax seal to modern QR code, morphing animation concept, clean modern design. Show a classical royal wax seal on the left gradually transforming/morphing into a clean, modern QR code on the right. Use a smooth gradient transition in the middle. Color scheme: warm gold/red for the wax seal transitioning to clean blue/white for the QR code. Background should be clean and minimal. Style: modern, elegant, showing evolution from old to new.
```

### 3. AI Development Metrics (Slide 13 - Innovation Showcase)
**Filename**: `ai-development-dashboard.png`
**Prompt**: 
```
Modern development dashboard showing AI collaboration metrics, code generation statistics, innovation visualization, tech aesthetic. Display charts showing 88% AI contribution, code generation graphs, development timeline, collaboration between human and AI. Include elements like: progress bars, pie charts, code snippets, AI icons, bolt.new branding elements. Color scheme: modern blues and purples with white background. Style: clean, professional dashboard UI with data visualization elements.
```

### 4. Global Trust Network (Slide 14 - The Vision)
**Filename**: `global-trust-network.png`
**Prompt**: 
```
Global network visualization showing connected trust relationships, digital seals spreading across the world, hopeful and expansive. Show a world map with glowing connection lines between continents, small seal/QR code icons scattered across different locations, data flowing between nodes, representing global trust network. Color scheme: deep blue background with bright blue/cyan connection lines and golden seal icons. Style: futuristic, optimistic, showing global connectivity and trust spreading worldwide.
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Generate these images using your preferred AI image generator (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
2. Save them in the `/public` folder with the specified filenames
3. The slides are already configured to use these images once they're available

## Current Workarounds

The presentation currently uses:
- Text-based visualization for Slide 7 (Expert's Curse)
- Icon-based transformation concept for Slide 8 (Digital Seals)
- Metrics display with numbers for Slide 13 (Innovation)
- Icon grid for Slide 14 (Vision)

These work well but the custom images will enhance the visual impact significantly.
